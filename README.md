## The provided code is a simple To-Do List application built using the Tkinter library in Python. Let me break down the key components and functionalities of the application:

**Importing Necessary Libraries**: The code starts with importing the required libraries, including Tkinter for GUI development and datetime for handling date and time operations.

**Creating the Tkinter Window**: A Tkinter window is created with a specific size and title.

**Functionality for Adding Tasks**: Users can input tasks in the Entry widget provided. When the "ADD" button is clicked, the entered task is added to the listbox, and also appended to a text file named "tasklist.txt" for persistent storage.

**Functionality for Marking Tasks as Completed**: Users can select a task from the listbox and click the "COMPLETED" button to mark it as completed. The completed task is visually distinguished by changing its text color to green.

**Functionality for Deleting Tasks**: Users can select a task from the listbox and click the "DELETE" button to remove it from the listbox and the text file.

**Displaying Tasks in the Listbox**: The tasks stored in the "tasklist.txt" file are loaded and displayed in the listbox upon application startup.

**Displaying Current Date**: The current date is displayed at the top of the window.

**GUI Styling**: The GUI elements are styled using images and colors to enhance the visual appeal of the application.
